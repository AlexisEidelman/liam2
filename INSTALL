Introduction
------------

To run a simulation from source, you first need to install all the
dependencies (see below), then (optionally) build the C extensions for
maximum performance, then simply run LIAM2 using:

python main.py import [your_import_file]
python main.py run [your_simulation_file]

Installation
------------

First install Python:

- Python 2.7.x (either 32 bits or 64 bits version): 
  http://www.python.org/download/releases/

Then you need to install all our other dependencies (third-party packages for
Python). If you are on Windows, the easiest way to install them is to use the
(unoffical) binary packages from Christoph Gohlke at: 

  http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Third party packages:

- Numpy 1.6.0 or later (for your version of python): 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/

- PyTables 2.2.1 or later (for your version of python):
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytables/files/pytables/
  
- Numexpr 2.0 or later (for your version of python):
  http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/downloads/
  
- PyYAML 3.0.8 or later (for your version of python):
  http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
  
- carray 0.4 or later (for your version of python):  
  http://carray.pytables.org/download/

Optional dependencies:

- Cython 0.16 or later (needed to build the C extensions, see below).
  http://www.cython.org/
  
- Sphinx 1.0 or later (to "build" the documentation to html, or pdf) 
  http://www.sphinx-doc.org/

Building the C extensions
-------------------------

Additionally, if you want to get maximum performance, you will also need to
build the C extensions. This is optional but recommended.

For that you need to have cython (see above) and a C compiler installed, then
go to the src/ directory of LIAM2 and type:

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If all goes according to plan, you should then be up and running.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

0) make sure both PYTHONDIR and PYTHONDIR\Scripts is in your system PATH
   where PYTHONDIR is the directory where you installed Python

1) Install sphinx 
2) Open a command prompt
3) Go to the documentation directory. For example:
 
  cd liam2\doc\usersguide\

3) Launch the build: 

  make html

4) Open the result in your favourite web browser. It is located in:
  
  build/html/index.html
