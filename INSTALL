To run a simulation, you need to install the following packages:

- Python 2.7.x (either 32 bits or 64 bits version): 
  http://www.python.org/download/releases/

- Numpy 1.6.0 or later (for your version of python): 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/

- PyTables 2.2.1 or later (for your version of python):
  http://www.pytables.org/download/stable/
  
- Numexpr 2.0 or later (for your version of python):
  http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/downloads/
  
- PyYAML 3.0.8 or later (for your version of python):
  http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
  
- carray 0.4 or later (for your version of python):  
  http://carray.pytables.org/download/stable/
  
Some of those libraries do not have official packages for windows 64 bits. 
You can find unofficial ones at:

To develop, you can use any text editor, or use an IDE like Eclipse with PyDev.
