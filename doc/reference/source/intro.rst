Introduction

The general objective of the *PROGRESS/MiDaL* project is to develop an advanced analysis tool that allows
Luxembourg and other countries at answering policy-related questions about pensions and social transfers in the
longer term trough microsimulation models. (PROGRESS-MiDaL: detailed description of the action and time schedule,
2009, 1). The project is targeting the development of a dynamic microsimulation modelling toolbox, named LIAM II
or LIAM-DMS.  However, *given time and budgetary constraints*, this project does not intend to fully implement
this toolbox but rather a *simplified version* (op. cit., page 3), concentrating on *a few important basic
instruments: database management functions, simulation engine, syntax parser*, and alignment procedures2.

The above paragraph comes from the  PROGRESS project description of MiDaL. This paper contains a practical manual
for the first version of LIAM DMS to be presented by the FPB during the Brussels workshop of February 24th. LIAM
DMS is primarily being developed by Gaëtan de Menten, in close collaboration with Geert Bryon. Gijs Dekkers holds
management of this part of the MiDaL project, and provides methodological assistance on microsimulation, and is
responsible for the extensive conceptual discussions that preceded the development process, and are still going on
today.

A word of warning is in order: this paper describes the version of LIAM DMS of January 24th. Its functionality is
however changing by the day, and the syntax is also under constant revision and expansion.
