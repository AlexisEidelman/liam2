The LIAM 2 package is developed at the Federal Planning Bureau of Belgium. 

This research is part of the MiDaL project, supported by the European Community Programme for Employment and
Social Solidarity - PROGRESS (2007-2013), under the Grant VS/2009/0569 Abstract - Project PROGRESS MiDaL
deliverable Work Package A. This paper presents and discusses a guide into developing dynamic microsimulation
models using LIAM 2. Both this manual and the software package LIAM 2 are very much work-in-progress, and are
therefore subject to change.

This guide describes version 0.2 of LIAM 2. Its functionality is however changing by the day, and
the syntax is also under constant revision and expansion.
