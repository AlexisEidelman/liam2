0.2

* Added breakpoint function, which launches the interactive console during 
  a simulation. Two more console commands are available in that mode: 
  - "s(tep)" to execute the next process
  - "r(esume)" to resume normal execution
  The breakpoint function takes an optional period argument so that it triggers
  only for that specific period.
  
* Processes which do not return any value (csv and show) do not need to be named
  anymore when they are inside of a procedure.
