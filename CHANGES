0.2

* Added breakpoint function, which brings the interactive console in the middle 
  of a simulation. Two more commands are available in that mode: 
  - "step" to execute the next process
  - "resume" to resume normal execution
  The breakpoint function takes an optional period argument so that it triggers
  only for that specific period.
  
* Processes which do not return any value (csv and show) do not need to be named
  anymore when they are inside of a procedure.
